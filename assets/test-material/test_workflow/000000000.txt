Exhibit 10.1
SECOND AMENDMENT
TO
SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT
     THIS SECOND AMENDMENT TO SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT (this
“Amendment”), dated as of April 20, 2011 is among SESI, L.L.C., as Borrower,
SUPERIOR ENERGY SERVICES, INC., as Parent, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., as Agent
(the “Agent”), and the Lenders party hereto, who agree as follows:
RECITALS
     A. The Borrower, Parent, Agent and certain of the Lenders have heretofore
executed a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of May 29, 2009
(the “Credit Agreement”).
     B. The Borrower proposes to issue senior unsecured notes due 2019 up to the
aggregate principal amount of $500,000,000 (the “2011 Senior Notes”), with the
intention of redeeming in full the Borrower’s existing 1.5% Senior Exchangeable
Notes due 2026 (the “Senior Exchangeable Notes”) when the latter become subject
to redemption not later than December 30, 2011. The Borrower proposes to use a
portion of the proceeds of the 2011 Senior Notes up to an aggregate of
$400,000,000 initially to repay in full the outstanding principal balance of the
Revolving Loan, and to retain the balance of the proceeds in cash or cash
equivalents until the Senior Exchangeable Notes are redeemable, at which time
the Borrower proposes to use such cash proceeds, other cash available to the
Borrower and/or advances available on the Revolving Loan to redeem the Senior
Exchangeable Notes in full on or before December 30, 2011. The Borrower proposes
to use the proceeds of the 2011 Senior Notes in excess of $400,000,000 for
general company purposes.
     C. In order to consummate the foregoing transaction, the Borrower has
requested modifications of the Credit Agreement in the following respects:
(i) to permit (as additional Funded Indebtedness) the 2011 Senior Notes; and
(ii) for the period from the issuance of the 2011 Senior Notes to and including
December 30, 2011, to exclude from Funded Indebtedness the cash proceeds of the
2011 Senior Notes retained in cash or cash equivalents (after repayment of the
Revolving Loan) for the redemption of the Senior Exchangeable Notes. Funded
Indebtedness shall not be reduced by the amount of any cash proceeds of the 2011
Senior Notes in excess of $400,000,000. The Agent and Lenders are willing to
accept the Borrower’s request on the terms and conditions set forth below.
     D. Capitalized terms used herein, and not otherwise defined herein, shall
have the meanings defined in the Credit Agreement.
     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and undertakings,
the parties hereby agree as follows:

 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     1.3 Except as specifically amended hereby, all of the remaining terms and
conditions of the Credit Agreement remain in full force and effect.

prior to June 20, 2011.
